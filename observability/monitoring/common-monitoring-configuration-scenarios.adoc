The default platform monitoring stack is available for use after installing {product-title}.
The in-cluster stack includes the core platform Prometheus instance that collects metrics from your cluster and the core Alertmanager instance that  routes alerts.

In addition to core platform monitoring, you can also optionally xref:../monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.adoc#enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects[enable monitoring for user-defined projects] for user workload monitoring.
After doing so, users can then monitor their own services and workloads without the need for an additional monitoring solution.

Depending on which users will use the monitoring stack and for what purposes, as a cluster administrator, you can configure monitoring components to suit the needs of different users in various scenarios.

== Monitoring for user-defined projects: First steps

As a cluster administrator, you can enable monitoring for user-defined projects in addition to core platform monitoring.
Doing so enables non-administrator users such as developers to monitor their own projects outside of core platform monitoring.

After you have completed these configuration activities, users can view collected metrics, query these metrics, and receive alerts for their own projects.
